### Thomas Walker Lynch

I work across computation theory, system design, and hardware–software integration.  
In addition to project management and architectural roles, I enjoy programming and  
building tools when they are needed.

Languages represented on this GitHub account include Racket, Common Lisp, C, C++,  
Java, and Python. I've also programmed in hardware description languages and  
various in-house systems.

Lately I’ve been exploring how a few small extensions to the C preprocessor can  
make C more pleasant to use without changing the language itself.
